This is a simple layout exercise that I decided to do ever since getting into Tailwind.
This application is a way for me to understand how a program like Fightcade would look and function if it were a web based application.
#This is not a real version of Fightcade so please do yourself a favor and  support and download Fightcade below if you enjoy playing fighting games or retro games in general.

# What is Fightcade? - https://www.fightcade.com/
Fightcade is a matchmaking application for playing retro games online, bundled with different emulators for seamless online play. Free, and without ads!

Fightcade comes with a custom GGPO implementation and other emulator improvements, making it the best platform for rollback-based P2P netplay. This means that demanding games in terms of input lag and responsiveness can be played over the internet with very little perceivable lag.
